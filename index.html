<h1>Fishing Spots in Colorado</h1>
<p>Colorado has lost of options for fishing whether you are interested in fly fishing for wild trout in the winding rivers or trying your hand had the hard fighting carp. <br> <br>
I have listed a few of the places that I like to fish in Colorado since I moved here last year. I have fished for trout and carp along with Bass in the local area. Before I started I did research across the web to find out some insider knowledge, the links to those sites are further on, they provide a lot of additional information. </p>

<h2> Deckers </h2>
<p> Deckers provides over a 10 mile stretch of the River Platte and is about and 45 minutes drive from highlands ranch. I had to learn how to fish the river and would recommend a guided fishing trip if you haven't fished the river before. <br> <br>
The local fishing tackle shop also provides a lot of helpful information and it is where you can arrange the guided trips.</p>
